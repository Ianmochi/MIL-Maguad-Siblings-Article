  <h2>The Murder of the Maguad Siblings: A Case of Betrayal, Violence, and Justice</h2>
  <p>üìç <strong>Location:</strong> Barangay Bagontapay, M'lang, Cotabato<br>
     üìÖ <strong>Date of Incident:</strong> December 10, 2021</p>
  <p>üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ <strong>Victims:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crizzlle Gwynn Orbe Maguad, 18 years old (Grade 12 honor student)</li>
    <li>Crizvlle Louis ‚ÄúBoyboy‚Äù Orbe Maguad, 16 years old (Grade 10 student)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üîç Background of the Case</h3>
  <p>The Maguad siblings were found lifeless in their home while their parents, who are both teachers, were away attending church activities. The only other person in the house at the time of the incident was their foster sister, Janice Sebial Emuelin, a minor who had been living with the family after being taken in for charitable reasons.</p>
  <p>Janice initially claimed that unidentified armed men entered the house and attacked the siblings. Her frantic Facebook posts during the event, pleading for help, went viral and gathered nationwide attention. However, deeper investigations revealed glaring inconsistencies in her story.</p>

  <h3>üìÖ Detailed Timeline of Events</h3>
  <p><strong>Before the Crime</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Janice was fostered by the Maguad family after reportedly suffering abuse in previous homes.</li>
    <li>Tensions reportedly grew in the household due to issues of discipline and Janice‚Äôs behavior.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>December 10, 2021</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Janice claimed three intruders entered the house and murdered her siblings.</li>
    <li>She managed to post on Facebook ‚ÄúPlease help. They‚Äôre inside the house.‚Äù</li>
    <li>Authorities were called and found the siblings bludgeoned to death, showing signs of torture and struggle.</li>
    <li>Janice was discovered ‚Äútied up,‚Äù presenting herself as a victim who had barely escaped.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>December 11‚Äì15, 2021</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Forensic experts found no signs of forced entry.</li>
    <li>Crime scene analysis showed the killer(s) were familiar with the house and victims.</li>
    <li>Blood-stained clothes belonging to Janice were found hidden nearby.</li>
    <li>The murder weapon bore Janice's fingerprints.</li>
    <li>Social media activity on Janice's phone showed suspicious usage patterns during the time she claimed to be restrained.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>December 16, 2021</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Police arrested Janice Sebial Emuelin and later named Esmeraldo Ca√±edo Jr., a close acquaintance of Janice, as a co-conspirator.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üßæ Key Evidence and Findings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No Forced Entry:</strong> All windows and doors were intact, with no signs of a break-in.</li>
    <li><strong>Weapon Fingerprints:</strong> Fingerprints on the weapon matched Janice's.</li>
    <li><strong>Clothing Evidence:</strong> Janice's blood-stained clothing was found hidden in a separate location.</li>
    <li><strong>Inconsistent Testimony:</strong> Janice‚Äôs version of events changed multiple times.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Media Contradictions:</strong> Despite claiming she was tied up, she was actively using Facebook Messenger.</li>
    <li><strong>Motive:</strong> Investigators suggested pent-up anger, jealousy, and resentment as key motives. Janice allegedly felt excluded and envious of the academic and familial attention her foster siblings received.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>‚öñÔ∏è Legal Proceedings and Verdict</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Trial held in Family Court due to the accused being a minor.</li>
    <li>The court determined that Janice acted with discernment‚Äîa legal term meaning she understood the consequences and gravity of her actions.</li>
    <li>Under Republic Act No. 9344 (Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006), minors who act with discernment during heinous crimes can be tried similarly to adults.</li>
    <li><strong>May 17, 2022:</strong> Janice was sentenced to 22 to 37 years imprisonment.</li>
    <li>Co-accused Esmeraldo Ca√±edo Jr. also faced legal action for conspiracy and direct involvement.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üí¨ Public and Media Response</h3>
  <p>The crime sparked outrage across social media under the trending hashtag <strong>#JusticeForMaguadSiblings</strong>. Thousands mourned the loss of two promising youths, and questions were raised about:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The effectiveness of the juvenile justice system</li>
    <li>Oversight and psychological support for children in foster care</li>
    <li>The role of social media in manipulating public sympathy</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In 2025, the case was featured in an episode of <em>MMK</em>, which brought the case back into public discourse. Some viewers saw the dramatization as educational, while others criticized it for exploiting the pain of the victims.</p>

  <h3>üß† Psychological, Criminological, and Legal Reflections</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Psychological:</strong> Experts highlighted Janice‚Äôs background of abuse and neglect as a possible contributor to her violent behavior.</li>
    <li><strong>Criminological:</strong> The Strain Theory was applied, suggesting that individuals commit crimes due to frustration and the inability to achieve goals through acceptable means.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal:</strong> Scholars debated how RA 9344 should evolve to balance rehabilitation with accountability in serious crimes involving minors.</li>
    <li>The case has become a case study in criminology and psychology classes, sparking discussions on reforming foster care and reevaluating discernment laws.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üïäÔ∏è Conclusion</h3>
  <p>The Maguad siblings‚Äô murder remains one of the most horrifying and emotionally charged criminal cases in recent Philippine history. It exposed vulnerabilities in foster systems, questioned the adequacy of juvenile protections in extreme crimes, and forced the nation to confront the possibility of violence from within the family.</p>
  <p>Justice may have been served through the courts, but the emotional and societal scars of this crime continue to be felt.</p>
